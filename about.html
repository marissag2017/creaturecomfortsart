                <h3>Our Artist</h3>
                <p>Rissa has been drawing for as long as she can remember, first finding inspiration in her childhood dog, a shih-tzu named Smokey. Her love of animals and nature only grew as she began horse-back riding at twelve years old and joining her local 4H club at fourteen. At twenty-two, Rissa served with a branch of AmeriCorps for five months, traveling the United States and working outdoors in all different kinds of enviornments and weather. These experiences only fueled Rissa's creativity and desire to capture the brilliance of nature within her artwork.</p>

                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>Creature Comforts began with Rissa's love for nature and a passion for art, but quickly grew into a small family buisness. From capybaras to cherry blossoms, we aim to bring a touch of cute and cozy to your world.</p>
                <p>We are strictly anti AI imagery and all of our stickers are printed through a trusted third-party manufacturer, ensuring quality and durability. We hope our designs can bring a smile to your face.</p>
